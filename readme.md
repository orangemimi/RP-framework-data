# RP-FRAMEWORK-DATA

This repository contains the data and notebooks used to reproduce the figures and tables reported in the manuscript *Quantifying reproducibility to support reliable geo-modelling research*.

## Repository Structure

### `Figures/fig.ipynb`
Generates the main figures used in the paper, including:

- **Fig. 2**
- **Fig. 6**
- **Fig. 7**
- **Fig. 8**
- **Fig. 12**
- **Fig. 13(a–d)**

> Note: **Fig. 14** is generated from the **Case 1 evaluation notebook** (see `case1/Evaluation*.ipynb`).

### `table2&3/`
This folder contains the results used to produce **Table 2** and **Table 3**.

The table results are organised by output type and data type:

- **1_Point/**
  - **Continuous/**
  - **Discrete/**
- **2_Sequence/**
  - **Continuous/**
  - **Discrete/**
- **3_Field/**
  - **Continuous/**
  - **Discrete/**

Within each subfolder, the experimental conditions are separated as:

- **`no-noisy/`**  
  Corresponds to **Condition A**: *aleatory uncertainty only*  
  (i.e., **Table 2: Reproduction results under Condition A**)

- **`has-noisy/`**  
  Corresponds to **Condition B**: *combined aleatory and epistemic uncertainty*  
  (i.e., **Table 3: Reproduction results under Condition B**)

### `case1/` and `case2/`
These two folders contain the evaluation outputs for the **two real-world case studies** reported in the paper:

- **`case1/`**: evaluation results for **Case 1** in the manuscript  
- **`case2/`**: evaluation results for **Case 2** in the manuscript  

Each case folder includes the corresponding inputs/outputs and notebooks used to compute the reported metrics and visualisations.

> Note: **Table 6** is generated by the case study evaluation notebooks, namely `case1/Evaluation*.ipynb` (Case 1) and `case2/Evaluation*.ipynb` (Case 2).

## Notes
- Folder names follow the paper’s output taxonomy: **Point / Sequence / Field** × **Continuous / Discrete**.
- If you only want the clean (aleatory-only) evaluation results, use the `no-noisy/` folders.
- If you want the combined uncertainty results (including epistemic effects), use the `has-noisy/` folders.

## Quick Start
1. Open and run `Figures/fig.ipynb` to reproduce **Fig. 2, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 13**.
2. Use the corresponding folders under `table2&3/` to locate the data for each table and scenario.
3. Run `case1/Evaluation*.ipynb` to reproduce **Fig. 14** and the **Case 1** evaluation outputs.
4. Run `case2/Evaluation*.ipynb` to reproduce the **Case 2** evaluation outputs and the corresponding values reported in **Table 6**.
