# RP-FRAMEWORK-DATA

This repository contains the data and notebooks used to reproduce the figures and tables reported in the manuscript *Quantifying reproducibility to support reliable geo-modelling research*.

## Repository Structure

### `Figures/`

#### `Figures/fig.ipynb`
Generates the main figures used in the paper, including:

- **Fig. 2**
- **Fig. 6**
- **Fig. 7**
- **Fig. 8**
- **Fig. 12**
- **Fig. 13(a–d)**

> Note: **Fig. 14** is generated from the **Case 1 evaluation notebook** (see `case1/Evaluation.ipynb`).

#### `Figures/CREST_Example_wjb_NSE/`
This folder is used to generate the input data (`case-comparison.xlsx`) for **Fig. 2**.

To reproduce, run:

```bash
cd Figures/CREST_Example_wjb_NSE/Rolling_forecast/
python rolling_forecast_paralleling.py
```

The raw results will be generated at:

```
./CREST_Example_wjb_NSE/Rolling_result/20100722/raw_forecast/
```

The raw output is then post-processed to produce the final `case-comparison.xlsx` used by `fig.ipynb`.

#### `Figures/initial-out12+13a/`
Contains `pred_nonoisy_initial.csv`, which is copied from:

```
table2&3/2Sequence/Discrete/no-noisy/initial-out/pred_nonoisy_initial
```

This file provides the input data used to generate **Fig. 12** and **Fig. 13(a)**.

#### `Figures/initial-out13b/`
Contains `pred_nonoisy_initial.csv`, which is copied from:

```
table2&3/2Sequence/Continuous/no-noisy/initial-out/pred_nonoisy_initial
```

This file provides the input data used to generate **Fig. 13(b)**.

### `table2&3/`
This folder contains the results used to produce **Table 2** and **Table 3**.

The table results are organised by output type and data type:

- **1_Point/**
  - **Continuous/**
  - **Discrete/**
- **2_Sequence/**
  - **Continuous/**
  - **Discrete/**
- **3_Field/**
  - **Continuous/**
  - **Discrete/**

Within each subfolder, the experimental conditions are separated as:

- **`no-noisy/`**  
  Corresponds to **Condition A**: *aleatory uncertainty only*  
  (i.e., **Table 2: Reproduction results under Condition A**)

- **`has-noisy/`**  
  Corresponds to **Condition B**: *combined aleatory and epistemic uncertainty*  
  (i.e., **Table 3: Reproduction results under Condition B**)

### `case1/`
This folder contains the reproduction and evaluation pipeline for **Case 1** in the manuscript.

#### `case1/1Reproduction.ipynb`
The notebook for **reproducing the original paper's results**. Run all cells from top to bottom. The reproduced outputs are saved to `case1/reoutputs/`.

#### `case1/2Evaluation.ipynb`
The notebook for **evaluating the reproduction quality**. Run all cells from top to bottom. The evaluation outputs are saved to `case1/evaluation-out/`.

> Note: **Fig. 14** and the **Case 1** values in **Table 6** are generated by this notebook.

#### `case1/inputs/`
Contains the **original data provided by the source paper**, used as inputs for reproduction.

#### `case1/reoutputs/`
Contains the **reproduced outputs** generated by running `Reproduced.ipynb`.

#### `case1/evaluation-out/`
Contains the **evaluation outputs** generated by running `Evaluation.ipynb`.

### `case2/`
This folder contains the reproduction and evaluation pipeline for **Case 2** in the manuscript.

#### `case2/1Reproduction.ipynb`
The notebook for **reproducing the original paper's results**. Run all cells from top to bottom. The reproduced outputs are saved to `case2/out/`.

#### `case2/2Evaluation.ipynb`
The notebook for **evaluating the reproduction quality**. Run all cells from top to bottom.

> Note: The **Case 2** values in **Table 6** are generated by this notebook.

#### `case2/Prediction_data.xlsx`
The **original data provided by the source paper**, used as inputs for reproduction.

#### `case2/out/`
Contains the **reproduced outputs** generated by running `Calculation.ipynb`.

- **`out/outputs.csv`**: the original experimental results from the source paper, used as a baseline for comparison.

## Notes
- Folder names follow the paper's output taxonomy: **Point / Sequence / Field** × **Continuous / Discrete**.
- If you only want the clean (aleatory-only) evaluation results, use the `no-noisy/` folders.
- If you want the combined uncertainty results (including epistemic effects), use the `has-noisy/` folders.

## Quick Start
1. Open and run `Figures/fig.ipynb` to reproduce **Fig. 2, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 13**.
2. Use the corresponding folders under `table2&3/` to locate the data for each table and scenario.
3. Run `case1/Reproduced.ipynb` to reproduce the **Case 1** results, then run `case1/Evaluation.ipynb` to reproduce **Fig. 14** and the **Case 1** evaluation outputs.
4. Run `case2/Calculation.ipynb` and `case2/Evaluation.ipynb` to reproduce the **Case 2** evaluation outputs and the corresponding values reported in **Table 6**.
